Live Fast stays pinned. This endpoint is for engine experiments.

| | Live | Lab |
|---|---|---|
| Image tag | `variant-fast:latest` (digest-pinned on the endpoint) | `variant-fast:lab` |
| Endpoint | `RUNPOD_FAST_ENDPOINT_ID` on Railway | `RUNPOD_FAST_LAB_ENDPOINT_ID` (not on production Railway) |
| Workers | max 2 | max 1, min 0 |
| Recycle | promote only | whenever |

CI: `.github/workflows/build-variant-fast-lab.yml` on `cursor/fast-shot-probe-c975`.

Do **not** set `RUNPOD_FAST_ENDPOINT_ID` on production Studio to the lab id.
Do **not** recycle live workers to test a lab digest.
